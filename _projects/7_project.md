This project examines the rise of the Bhim Army—a grassroots Dalit rights organisation—and its innovative use of social media to mobilise support, shape identity, and challenge caste hierarchies in North India. Set against the backdrop of the decline of the Bahujan Samaj Party and the ascent of Hindu nationalism, the study situates the Bhim Army within a broader lineage of Dalit-Bahujan politics. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines digital ethnography, semi-structured interviews, and network analysis of over one million social media posts, the thesis explores how the Bhim Army constructs a hybrid digital counterpublic, blending online activism with on-ground resistance. It argues that the organisation’s mobilisations reflect a form of radical constitutionalism—redefining power, asserting victimhood, and forging new political imaginaries through digital means. The thesis contributes to emerging scholarship on caste, digital mobilisation, and social movements in contemporary India.
