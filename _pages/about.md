I am a PhD Candidate in the School of Geography at the University of Melbourne. My doctoral research looks at young Muslim people's everyday navigations of converging crises of Hindu Nationalism, unemployment, and social change in India. I have conducted over 14 months of ethnographic fieldwork in the North Indian city of Saharanpur and am currently in the process of writing my thesis. An advance paper drawing from my research with young people studying in a leading Deobandi Madrasa has recently been published in by Environment and Planning D: Society and Space. It can be found <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02637758241302198'> here </a>. My second empirical chapter which looks at young people working as Amazon resellers in a small city is currently under review.

In April 2024, I contested (unsuccessfully) for the Graduate Student Association at the University of Melbourne on the issues of student food insecurity, salary indexation, and ending research ties with weapons manufacturers--coming in second. I was elected to the board of the Geographies of Religion and Belief Systems (GORABS) group at the American Association of Geographers (AAG).

I also co-convene the <a href='https://x.com/SAFUnimelb'> South Asia Forum </a> at the University of Melbourne through which I recently organised a seminar series on "Queer(ing) South Asia in Australia" bringing together queer artists, drag performers, activists, and academics of South Asian descent working in Melbourne. 
Before my PhD, I worked as a Research Associate in the Politics team at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), New Delhi. At CPR, I was involved in producing two research reports on political parties in India as well as leading the team's programming in the run-up to the 2022 UP and Punjab assembly elections. 

My master's thesis at Ashoka University analysed the rise of the Bhim Army--a popular on-ground Dalit youth movement in North India, with a special focus on the organisation's use of social media. The results from the thesis have been published in the form of <a href=publications> two journal articles </a>. I am working on publishing a third article on the Azad Samaj Party--the political wing of the Bhim Army. 

I graduated with a B.A (Honours) in Political Science from Kirori Mal College at the University of Delhi.
